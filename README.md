Abstract: 

Quantum entanglement offers promising capabilities for distributed sensing networks, but their performance under realistic noise conditions remains an open question. This work investigates the behavior of remotely entangled photonic systems when subjected to chaotic noise and formulates the redesigning for the current Continuous-Variable experimental setup. Using a four-mode entangled continuous-variable state, we investigate a four-node distributed sensing network using hybrid classical-quantum optimizers and quantum machine learning approaches. Our method shows how an entangled quantum network may be used to detect averaged phase shifts among dispersed noisy nodes. We use hybrid quantum optimization methods to optimize the network's performance and characterize the system's resilience to different noise levels. The findings shed light on the limitations and opportunities for improvement of entanglement-based sensing in noisy environments. We also provide a set of standards for assessing and contrasting the performance of current and upcoming experimental systems.
